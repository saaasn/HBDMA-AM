            <p>Dear Ma'am Arlhene,</p>
            <p>Hm... Wow, I really can't believe an ICT teacher would click on malicious links! Okay, joking aside, happy advance birthday, Ma'am! And what other way to greet you through... scamm—I mean, making this little website. I hope the quality is up to par for a project that was initiated at 12 in the morning. In fact, I am still working on this during our first subject, but I digress. You've been such a great teacher for us: understanding, caring, and really easy to get along with! Even if Rizal may not be so... outspoken? [FALSE] compared to other sections, I can count a lot of fun moments we had, albeit in one hand, BUT STILL. As a teacher, I truly do feel grateful with how you initiate especially when a certain number of students may find something difficult. With how you interact with the class, it doesn't feel as if we, as students, may be restricted or such in a sense that you feel easily approachable. Lastly, I'll truly remember the little short life lessons (...strands) you've given us during our last CPE. </p>
            <p>To more memories and no malwares,</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Novisteros, 10 Rizal</p>
